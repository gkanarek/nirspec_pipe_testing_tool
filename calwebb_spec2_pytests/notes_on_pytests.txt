NOTES ON Pytests

*** All steps:
- need to uncomment the line where the pipeline actually runs.

*** In the test of extract 2d step:
* test.py:
- an extra directory or path is required to specify where the MSA configuration file will live.
- we will have to verify the naming convention for this msa configuration file.

* once WCS is functional in the pipeline, have to uncomment the lines to actually run this step on the wcs scripts in the auxiliary code directory for: MOS, FS.


* For IFU wcs script, there is nor current way of differentiating from two dictionary entries with the same filter/grating configuration. The code will currently take the last entry, and return that esafile name
